# Week11-Hangman
Hangman game which runs entirely with **Node.js**.

## Synopsis

Takes the Hangman game and empowers it with JavaScript constructors. Unlike the original front-end hangman app, this Hangman game will run entirely with Node.js.


## Project Structure

Contains files **game.js**, **letter.js**, **main.js** and **word.js**.
This console-based hangman app incorporates objects, user-input, and constructors to create a functioning game.


### word.js 
contains all of the methods which check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.

### letter.js
Controls whether or not a letter appears as a _ or as itself on-screen.

### game.js
Randomly select a word for the player.

### main.js
Contain the logic of the hangman app. 

Running the app in Terminal/Bash will start the game.
The app ends when a player guesses the correct word or runs out of guesses.



## Motivation

To revisit an old application and make it a console based app on **Node.js** using constructors.
